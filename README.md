# The End Times

A comparison of programming language implementation performance.

## Rules

* Each test program should implement the same algorithm.

* No FFI.

* Different language implementations (e.g. GCC and Clang) may have
  different test programs.

## License

Code is under the BSD license, and includes code originally from The
Computer Language Benchmarks Game.

## Preliminary Results

* Haskell (GHC) took 4.503 seconds
* Python3 (CPython) took 18.839 seconds
* Python3 (pypy) took 14.265 seconds
* Ruby (JRuby) took 53.936 seconds
* Ruby (MRI) took 27.182 seconds
* Rust (Rust) took 25.203 seconds
